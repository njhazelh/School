To keep it organized, we broke this program into two files.

pong-client.rkt contains the client
pong-server.rkt contains the server

To run both files in conjunction:

1.) Run pong-server.rkt and type (run-server) into the interactions window.

2.) Run pong-client.rkt and type (launch-two-clients LOCALHOST) into the interactions window.
	-  This will start two clients aimed at the local server
	-  To aim at a different server-ip simply enter "<SERVER_IP>" instead of LOCALHOST

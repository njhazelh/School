  Static method
    binTree     : Comparator<String>    ->  BTree (the constructor)


  Dynamic methods (for which the receiver is an BTree):
    build       : Iterable<String>      ->  void
    toString    :                       ->  String
    equals      : Object                ->  boolean
    hashCode    :                       ->  int
    iterator    :                       -> Iterator<String>


You are required to document your implementation with an abstraction function
(that should include the two requirement described above),
as well as with the representation invariant comments for every method in your code.

Additionally, you are required to design the 'repOK'
methods for your implementation that will be included in your class definitions.

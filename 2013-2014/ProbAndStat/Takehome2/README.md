The code in this folder relates to problem 6 from the second takehome test from my Probability and Statistics class in Fall 2013.

The problem provides a set of data with 1000 entries.  We were to randomly choose 40 of these entries (20 control, 20 test), and analyse the data to decide whether the mean of the data sets (control vs test) were significantly different.

README
------

run1, run2, run3, run4 in Makefile are the 4 different tests given for the assignment.

The default make command will run all 4 tests. It's a lot of text.

The test addresses given in the same block of text is an array at the top of my code called test_set.

The results of the tests are in test1.txt - test4.txt.

Thanks,

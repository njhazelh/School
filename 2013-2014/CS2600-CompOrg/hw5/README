run1, run2, run3, run4 in Makefile are the 4 different tests given for the assignment.

The default make command will run all 4 tests. It's a lot of text.

The test addresses given in the same block of text is an array at the top of my code called test_set.

I am not sure what else could be meant by include the 4 tests.  You can run my code to get the output for yourself.

Thanks,

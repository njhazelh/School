These were a few tips from my friend that just finished the project:
I wouldn't make a PC module, by the way.
Just calculate a "next pc" and assign it to the pc every posedge of the clock cycle.
Then continuously assign pc to the instruction address.
Also, make sure to start your pc at 0x00001000
That took us a while to figure out.
Also, make sure to time the reg writing with the positive edge of the clock.
Then, update the reads every time their selects change.
These pointers literally took us hours to figure out, so I hope that saves you time.
And take advantage of the boolean logic available to you.
Namely, assign the "branch select" for the branch mux to be equal to branch & zero.
Take advantage of those assignment statements and feeding specific bits directly into things
(instruction [15:0], etc...). It really simplifies the coding, because you don't need to have a new wire.
Calculate next pc, then assign it to pc on the posedge of the clock if it's not 32'hx.

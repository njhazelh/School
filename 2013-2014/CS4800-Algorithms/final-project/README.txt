1.) What language did you implement this in?


2.) Does your code require building before it can be executed?


3) Describe in one paragraph or less the algorithm you implemented.


4) Does your implementation pass all of the given test cases? If not, specify which ones it fails on. This also includes failure to terminate within an appropriate amount of time.


5) Approximately how long does your solution take on very large inputs? (2.5 million variables, 2.5 million constraints).


6) What is the worst case order notation run time of your implementation? Depending on what sort of data structure you implemented, it may be appropriate to do some amortized analysis here.
